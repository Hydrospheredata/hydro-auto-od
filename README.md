# hydro-auto-od

`hydro-auto-od` service is responsible for creating monitoring metrics for deployed machine learning models via unsuperviesd AutoML techniques. Each time a new model version is uploaded
to the cluster, sonar service calls `hydro-auto-od` service by the `/auto_metric` endpoint.
This launches a process of creating a metric for monitoring this new model. There are more details in Creating Auto Metric State Diagram part.

To use this service, first look at OpenAPI spec in [hydro_auto_od_openapi.yaml](hydro-auto-od-openapi.yaml)


## Creating Auto Metric State Diagram
![](docs/hydro_auto_od_state_diagram.png)
## Which models are eligible for creating an auto-od metric?
 hydro-auto-od creates metric which uses all supported fields of a model signature. If model 
 signature has no supported fields, then there are no way to create an auto-od metric, and state of training job shall be `SIGNATURE_NOT_SUPPORTED`
 
 Supported fields are:
 * of scalar shape
 * of types:
    * DT_HALF
    * DT_FLOAT
    * DT_DOUBLE
    * DT_INT8
    * DT_INT16
    * DT_INT32
    * DT_INT64
    * DT_UINT8
    * DT_UINT16
    * DT_UINT32
    * DT_UINT64

In future more model fields will be supported.
